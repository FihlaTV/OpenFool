OpenFool
========

OpenFool - free and open source (GPL v3) Fool (Durak) card game implementation.
Currently (as of 0.0.1) it's only for 4-players partnership play (with 52-card Russian deck), and AI is quite weak (tends to throw high cards - trumps, aces etc).

You can download Windows binaries (from Releases page) or build from sources (you need Qt 5.7+). If you found any bugs or propose new features, don't hesitate to create issues on Github (please write in English) or (if the former is impossible) just PM me.
